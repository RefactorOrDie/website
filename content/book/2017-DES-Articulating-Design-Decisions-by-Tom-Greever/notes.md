Greever writes that above everything, communication is the defining skill of the best designers.

 * How to foster a collaborative environment which allows for flexibility and innovation
 * How to bring your client with you as you make decisions
 * How to get feedback early and often and maintain boundaries

Having a strong relationship with the client leads to the best possible work, so start with that, since the majority of extremely talented designers are limited by a relationship with low levels of trust.
